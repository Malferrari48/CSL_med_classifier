# CSL_med_classifier

This is my project for the "Computational and Statistical Learning" exam.

The project involved choosing from a selection of datasets and performing regression and/or classification using at least two models for comparison.

I used [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/), specifically PneumoniaMNIST, and classified it using SVM and Random Forest. But first, I conducted PCA analysis to visualize 2-dimensional graphs and, more importantly, to reduce the dimensionality of the images for faster training and testing.

From the graphs, it can be seen that the accuracy does not exceed 0.86, most likely because the distribution of the test set differs slightly from that of the training and validation sets.

For more details, please refer to the Jupyter file and the links within.

The project, along with the oral presentation, resulted in a grade of 27/30.
